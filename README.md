The main features of our project include employee management, project assignment, leave
management, attendance tracking, and performance monitoring. Managers can add, edit, and
remove employees, assign multiple projects to each employee, and monitor their progress. Each
employee can have several projects assigned, and these are managed through a dedicated section in
the dashboard. Projects are stored in the database as part of each employee's record, and managers
can view, edit, or delete these projects as needed.
For project assignment, the system allows managers to specify the project name, start date, and
deadline for each assignment. The frontend displays all employees in one column and lists all their
specific projects in the next column, making it easy to see which projects are assigned to whom. This
structure helps managers quickly assess workload distribution and project timelines.
Additionally, the system includes leave management, where employees can apply for leaves and
managers can approve or deny them. Attendance is tracked for each employee, and performance
data is visualized using charts. The backend provides RESTful APIs for all these operations, ensuring
smooth communication between the frontend and the database.
Overall, EmpTracker provides a user-friendly and efficient way to manage employees, projects,
leaves, and attendance, making it a valuable tool for any organization looking to digitize and optimize
their HR processes.
